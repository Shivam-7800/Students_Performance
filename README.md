# Student Performance Prediction Documentation
# Overview
This project aims to predict student performance (pass/fail) based on various factors such as demographic information and academic scores. The prediction model utilizes logistic regression and incorporates features like gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, as well as math, reading, and writing scores.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information on student demographics, academic scores, and other relevant factors. It includes the following columns:

# gender: 
Gender of the student (categorical: 'male' or 'female').
# race/ethnicity:
Ethnicity or race of the student (categorical: 'group A', 'group B', 'group C', 'group D', 'group E').
# parental level of education:
Education level of the student's parents (categorical: 'some high school', 'high school', 'some college', 'associate's degree', 'bachelor's degree', 'master's degree').
# lunch: 
Type of lunch received by the student (categorical: 'standard' or 'free/reduced').
# test preparation course: 
Whether the student completed a test preparation course (categorical: 'none' or 'completed').
# math score: 
Score obtained in math exam (numeric: 0-100).
# reading score: 
Score obtained in reading exam (numeric: 0-100).
# writing score:
Score obtained in writing exam (numeric: 0-100).
Preprocessing
# Label Encoding:
Categorical variables are encoded using LabelEncoder from scikit-learn to convert them into numerical format.
# Feature Engineering: 
The average of math, reading, and writing scores is calculated to represent overall academic performance. This average score is then used as the target variable.
# Train-Test Split:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Building

# Logistic Regression:
A logistic regression model is trained using the training data to predict student performance based on the selected features.
# Standardization:
Features are standardized using StandardScaler from scikit-learn to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which helps improve model performance.
# Evaluation
# Accuracy: 
The accuracy of the model is calculated to measure its overall performance in predicting student performance.
# Classification Report:
A detailed classification report is generated, including precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the model's performance for each class (pass/fail).
# Conclusion
The logistic regression model demonstrates promising results in predicting student performance based on demographic information and academic scores. Further improvements and refinements can be made by exploring additional features and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms.
